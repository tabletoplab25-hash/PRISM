        <h1>PRISM</h1>
        <p class="subtitle">A Strategic Color Card Game for 2-6 Players</p>

        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>PRISM is a tactical card game where each color has unique scoring abilities. Players must carefully choose which cards to play and which to pass to opponents, creating a dynamic game of strategy, prediction, and calculated risks.</p>

        <h2>Components</h2>
        <p>PRISM uses a special deck system where card duplicates exist:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>5 Colors:</strong> Red, Blue, Green, Yellow, Purple</li>
            <li><strong>4 Values:</strong> 1, 2, 3, 4 (each card's number equals its victory point value)</li>
            <li><strong>Multiple Copies:</strong> Each card exists in up to 3 copies</li>
        </ul>

        <table>
            <tr>
                <th>Players</th>
                <th>Values Used</th>
                <th>Copies per Value</th>
                <th>Total Cards in Deck</th>
                <th>Cards per Player</th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>2</td>
                <td>1, 2, 3</td>
                <td>2 copies</td>
                <td>30</td>
                <td>10 (10 cards discarded)</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>3</td>
                <td>1, 2, 3, 4</td>
                <td>2 copies</td>
                <td>40</td>
                <td>10 (10 cards discarded)</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>4</td>
                <td>1, 2, 3, 4</td>
                <td>2 copies</td>
                <td>40</td>
                <td>10 (no cards discarded)</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>5</td>
                <td>1, 2, 3, 4</td>
                <td>3 copies</td>
                <td>60</td>
                <td>10 (10 cards discarded)</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>6</td>
                <td>1, 2, 3, 4</td>
                <td>3 copies</td>
                <td>60</td>

            </tr>
        </table>

        <h2>Card Values</h2>
        <p><strong>Simple Rule:</strong> A card's number equals its victory point value.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Card 1 = 1 victory point</li>
            <li>Card 2 = 2 victory points</li>
            <li>Card 3 = 3 victory points</li>
            <li>Card 4 = 4 victory points</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This makes scoring intuitive and allows duplicates to have consistent value across all player counts.</p>

        <h2>Setup</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Select the appropriate cards based on player count (see table above)</li>
            <li>Shuffle all cards together</li>
            <li>Deal 10 cards to each player</li>
            <li>Remove remaining cards from the game (face-down, out of play)</li>
            <li>All players start with 0 points</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Game Flow</h2>
        <p>The game consists of 10 rounds. Each round follows these phases:</p>

        <h3>1. Selection Phase</h3>
        <p>All players simultaneously choose one card from their hand to play face-down.</p>

        <h3>2. Reveal Phase</h3>
        <p>All cards are revealed simultaneously. Points are calculated based on each color's special ability (see Color Abilities section).</p>

        <h3>3. Passing Phase</h3>
        <p>Each player chooses one card from their remaining hand to pass to the player on their right. This is a strategic decision that affects future rounds.</p>

        <h2>Color Abilities</h2>
        <p>The core of PRISM's strategy lies in understanding how each color scores:</p>

        <div class="color-box">
            <h4>🔴 RED - Double or Nothing</h4>
            <p>The LOWEST VALUE red card(s) score double points. All other red cards score negative points.</p>
            <p><strong>Important:</strong> If multiple players play the same lowest value, ALL of them score ×2.</p>
            <div class="example">
                <strong>Example:</strong> Two Red 2s (2pt each) and one Red 3 (3pt) are played.<br>
                • Both Red 2 players: 2 × 2 = +4 points each (tied for lowest)<br>
                • Red 3 player: -3 points<br>
                <br>
                <strong>Note:</strong> The negative score equals the card's value, not doubled.
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="color-box">
            <h4>🔵 BLUE - Shared Pool</h4>
            <p>All blue card points are added together and divided equally among players who played blue (round down).</p>
            <div class="example">
                <strong>Example:</strong> Three players play Blue 2 (2pt), Blue 3 (3pt), and Blue 4 (4pt).<br>
                • Total pool: 2 + 3 + 4 = 9 points<br>
                • Each player gets: 9 ÷ 3 = 3 points<br>
                <br>
                <strong>Duplicate Example:</strong> Two players play Blue 2 (2pt each), one plays Blue 4 (4pt).<br>
                • Total pool: 2 + 2 + 4 = 8 points<br>
                • Each player gets: 8 ÷ 3 = 2 points (rounded down)
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="color-box">
            <h4>🟢 GREEN - Anti-Majority</h4>
            <p>Each green card loses 1 point for every LOWER VALUE green card played.</p>
            <p><strong>Important:</strong> Cards of the same value do NOT clash with each other.</p>
            <div class="example">
                <strong>Example:</strong> Green 2, Green 3, Green 4 are played.<br>
                • Green 2 (2pt) - 0 lower greens = 2 points<br>
                • Green 3 (3pt) - 1 lower green (the 2) = 2 points<br>
                • Green 4 (4pt) - 2 lower greens (the 2 and 3) = 2 points<br>
                <br>
                <strong>Duplicate Example:</strong> Two Green 2s (2pt each) and one Green 4 (4pt) are played.<br>
                • Both Green 2 players: 2 - 0 = 2 points (same value cards don't clash)<br>
                • Green 4 player: 4 - 2 = 2 points (two lower greens)<br>
                <br>
                <strong>Note:</strong> Green can go negative if there are many lower greens!
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="color-box">
            <h4>🟡 YELLOW - Relative Scoring</h4>
            <p><strong>+1 point</strong> for each OTHER yellow card played.<br>
            <strong>-1 point</strong> for each LOWER VALUE card of OTHER colors played.</p>
            <p><strong>Important:</strong> Cards of the same value from other colors do NOT penalize yellow.</p>
            <div class="example">
                <strong>Example:</strong> You play Yellow 3 (3pt base). Others play: Yellow 2, Yellow 4, Red 2, Green 3, Blue 4.<br>
                • Base: 3 points<br>
                • +2 points (two other yellows: 2 and 4)<br>
                • -1 point (one lower value other color: Red 2. Green 3 doesn't count because it's same value)<br>
                • <strong>Total: 3 + 2 - 1 = 4 points</strong><br>
                <br>
                <strong>Duplicate Example:</strong> You play Yellow 2. Others play: Yellow 2, Red 1, Red 1.<br>
                • Base: 2 points<br>
                • +1 point (one other yellow)<br>
                • -2 points (two lower value cards: both Red 1s)<br>
                • <strong>Total: 2 + 1 - 2 = 1 point</strong><br>
                <br>
                <strong>Note:</strong> Yellow 1 is always safe (no lower cards possible) but scores fewer points!
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="color-box">
            <h4>🟣 PURPLE - Cooperation (Player Count Dependent)</h4>
            <p><strong>2-3 Players:</strong> Purple scores positive ONLY if you're the ONLY purple played. If others also play purple, you score negative.</p>
            <p><strong>4-6 Players:</strong> Purple scores positive if at least 1 OTHER purple is played. If you're the only purple, you score negative.</p>
            <div class="example">
                <strong>Example (2 players):</strong><br>
                • If only you play purple → Positive!<br>
                • If both play purple → Both negative!<br>
                <br>
                <strong>Example (5 players):</strong><br>
                • If 2+ purples played → All purples positive! (cooperation)<br>
                • If only 1 purple played → That player negative (no cooperation)
            </div>
        </div>

        <h2>End of Game</h2>
        <p>After 10 rounds, the game ends. The player with the highest total score wins!</p>

        <h2>Strategy Tips</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Red:</strong> Play low to win big, but watch out for even lower reds!</li>
            <li><strong>Blue:</strong> Safe and consistent. Good for medium-value cards.</li>
            <li><strong>Green:</strong> Play high to avoid penalties from lower greens.</li>
            <li><strong>Yellow:</strong> Complex but powerful. Predict what others will play.</li>
            <li><strong>Purple:</strong> Risk everything for cooperation (or uniqueness in 2-3p).</li>
            <li><strong>Passing:</strong> Give away dangerous cards or set up future combinations.</li>
            <li><strong>Card Counting:</strong> Remember what colors have been played to predict opponents' hands.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Game Variants</h2>
        <p>PRISM offers different variants to adjust the level of information and strategic depth.</p>

        <h3>Standard Variant (Hidden Information)</h3>
        <p>This is the classic PRISM experience. All players start with 10 cards in hand, completely hidden from opponents. This creates maximum uncertainty and emphasizes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Memory and card counting</li>
            <li>Risk assessment</li>
            <li>Psychological reads</li>
            <li>Adapting to unexpected reveals</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Open Information Variant (Recommended for Strategic Players)</h3>
        <p>This variant reduces blind play and adds visible planning opportunities.</p>

        <div class="color-box">
            <h4>🎲 Setup Differences</h4>
            <p>Each player receives their 10 cards split into:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>5 cards in hand</strong> (hidden from opponents)</li>
                <li><strong>5 visible cards</strong> (face-up, visible to all players)</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="color-box">
            <h4>📋 Gameplay Rules</h4>
            <p><strong>Playing Cards:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>You can ONLY play cards from your hand (hidden cards)</li>
                <li>Visible cards cannot be played directly</li>
                <li>This maintains suspense while giving strategic information</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p><strong>Passing Cards:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Priority 1:</strong> Visible cards are passed FIRST (automatically, one per round)</li>
                <li>When you pass a visible card, it becomes HIDDEN for the player who receives it</li>
                <li><strong>Priority 2:</strong> Once all visible cards are exhausted, pass from your hand as in Standard variant</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="example">
            <strong>Example Round in Open Variant:</strong><br><br>
            <strong>Setup:</strong> You have Yellow 8, Blue 3, Red 2 visible. In hand: Purple 5, Green 9, Red 10, Blue 7, Yellow 4.<br><br>
            <strong>Round 1 - Play:</strong> You play Purple 5 from your hand. Your visible cards remain unchanged.<br><br>
            <strong>Round 1 - Pass:</strong> Your first visible card (Yellow 8) is automatically passed to the right. That player receives it in their hand (hidden). You now have 4 visible cards and 4 cards in hand.<br><br>
            <strong>Strategic Note:</strong> Everyone saw you pass Yellow 8! They know your opponent received it and can plan accordingly.
        </div>

        <h3>Why Play Open Information?</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Less "blind" gameplay:</strong> You know what cards are coming and where they'll go</li>
            <li><strong>Enhanced strategy:</strong> Plan several rounds ahead based on visible information</li>
            <li><strong>Social dynamics:</strong> "I'm passing you a Purple 10... you'd better play it!"</li>
            <li><strong>Reduced luck:</strong> Skilled players can better predict and control outcomes</li>
            <li><strong>Teaching tool:</strong> New players can observe what cards are in play</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="important">
            ⚠️ <strong>Important:</strong> Once visible cards are depleted (after 5 rounds), both variants play identically. This creates an interesting transition from open information to hidden information mid-game!
