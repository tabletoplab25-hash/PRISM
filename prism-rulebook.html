        <h1>PRISM</h1>
        <p class="subtitle">A Strategic Color Card Game for 2-6 Players</p>

        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>PRISM is a tactical card game where each color has unique scoring abilities. Players must carefully choose which cards to play and which to pass to opponents, creating a dynamic game of strategy, prediction, and calculated risks.</p>

        <h2>Components</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Unique Deck:</strong> 5 colors (Red, Blue, Green, Yellow, Purple)</li>
            <li>Card values: 1, 2, 3, 4 (points = value)</li>
            <li>Each player receives exactly 10 cards</li>
            <li>Remaining cards are removed from play (face-down)</li>
        </ul>

        <table>
            <tr>
                <th>Players</th>
                <th>Deck Composition</th>
                <th>Total Cards</th>
                <th>Discarded</th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>2</td>
                <td>2 copies of values 1-3</td>
                <td>30</td>
                <td>10</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>3</td>
                <td>+ 1 copy of value 4</td>
                <td>35</td>
                <td>5</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>4</td>
                <td>+ 1 more copy of value 4</td>

                <td>0</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>

            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>6</td>
                <td>Same as 5 players</td>

                <td>0</td>
            </tr>
        </table>

        <h2>Card Values</h2>
        <p>The number on the card equals its victory point value. Simple!</p>
        
        <div class="example">
            <strong>Card Value = Points:</strong><br>
            • Card 1 = 1 point<br>
            • Card 2 = 2 points<br>
            • Card 3 = 3 points<br>
            • Card 4 = 4 points
        </div>

        <h2>Setup</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Shuffle all cards together</li>
            <li>Deal 10 cards to each player</li>
            <li>All players start with 0 points</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Game Flow</h2>
        <p>The game consists of 10 rounds. Each round follows these phases:</p>

        <h3>1. Selection Phase</h3>
        <p>All players simultaneously choose one card from their hand to play face-down.</p>

        <h3>2. Reveal Phase</h3>
        <p>All cards are revealed simultaneously. Points are calculated based on each color's special ability (see Color Abilities section).</p>

        <h3>3. Passing Phase</h3>
        <p>Each player chooses one card from their remaining hand to pass to the player on their right. This is a strategic decision that affects future rounds.</p>


        <h2>Color Abilities</h2>
        <p>The core of PRISM's strategy lies in understanding how each color scores:</p>

        <div class="color-box">
            <h4>🔴 RED - Double or Nothing</h4>
            <p>The LOWEST red card scores double points. All other red cards score negative points.</p>
            <div class="example">
                <strong>Example:</strong> Red 1, Red 3, Red 4 are played.<br>
                • Red 1 (1pt base) = +2 points (doubled!)<br>
                • Red 3 (3pt base) = -3 points<br>
                • Red 4 (4pt base) = -4 points
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="color-box">
            <h4>🔵 BLUE - Anchor</h4>
            <p>All blue cards score points equal to the LOWEST blue value played. The lowest blue "anchors" everyone's score.</p>
            <div class="example">
                <strong>Example:</strong> Three players play Blue 1, Blue 3, and Blue 4.<br>
                • Lowest blue value: 1<br>
                • All three players score: 1 point each
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="color-box">
            <h4>🟢 GREEN - Anti-Majority</h4>
            <p>Each green card loses <strong>2 points per unique lower VALUE</strong> (duplicate values count as one). <strong>Minimum 0 points</strong> (can't go negative).</p>
            <div class="example">
                <strong>Example 1:</strong> Green 3, Green 2, Green 2 are played.<br>
                • Green 2 (2pt) - 0 unique lower values = 2 points<br>
                • Green 2 (2pt) - 0 unique lower values = 2 points<br>
                • Green 3 (3pt) - 1 unique lower value (the 2) = 3 - 2 = 1 point<br>
                <br>
                <strong>Example 2:</strong> Green 3, Green 2, Green 1 are played.<br>
                • Green 1 (1pt) - 0 unique lower values = 1 point<br>
                • Green 2 (2pt) - 1 unique lower value = 2 - 2 = 0 points<br>
                • Green 3 (3pt) - 2 unique lower values = 3 - 4 = -1 → <strong>0 points</strong> (floor)
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="color-box">
            <h4>🟡 YELLOW - Relative Scoring</h4>
            <p><strong>+1 point</strong> for each OTHER yellow card played.<br>
            <strong>-1 point</strong> for each LOWER card of OTHER colors played.</p>
            <div class="example">
                <strong>Example:</strong> You play Yellow 4 (4pt base). Others play: Yellow 2, Yellow 3, Red 1, Green 2, Blue 3.<br>
                • Base: 4 points<br>
                • +2 points (two other yellows: 2 and 3)<br>
                • -3 points (three lower other colors: Red 1, Green 2, Blue 3)<br>
                • <strong>Total: 4 + 2 - 3 = 3 points</strong><br>
                <br>
                <strong>Note:</strong> Yellow 1 is safe (no lower cards possible) but scores fewer base points.
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="color-box">
            <h4>🟣 PURPLE - Cooperation (Player Count Dependent)</h4>
            <p><strong>2-3 Players:</strong> Purple scores positive ONLY if you're the ONLY purple played. If others also play purple, you score 0 points.</p>
            <p><strong>4-6 Players:</strong> Purple scores positive if at least 1 OTHER purple is played. If you're the only purple, you score 0 points.</p>
            <div class="example">
                <strong>Example (2 players):</strong><br>
                • If only you play purple → Positive!<br>
                • If both play purple → Both score 0 points!<br>
                <br>
                <strong>Example (5 players):</strong><br>
                • If 2+ purples played → All purples positive! (cooperation)<br>
                • If only 1 purple played → That player scores 0 points (no cooperation)
            </div>
        </div>

        <h2>End of Game</h2>
        <p>After 10 rounds, the game ends. The player with the highest total score wins!</p>

        <h2>Strategy Tips</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Red:</strong> Play low to win big, but watch out for even lower reds!</li>
            <li><strong>Blue:</strong> Your high blues are vulnerable to low blues! Try to avoid playing alone.</li>
            <li><strong>Green:</strong> Play high to avoid penalties from lower greens.</li>
            <li><strong>Yellow:</strong> Complex but powerful. Predict what others will play.</li>
            <li><strong>Purple:</strong> Risk everything for cooperation (or uniqueness in 2-3p).</li>
            <li><strong>Passing:</strong> Give away dangerous cards or set up future combinations.</li>
            <li><strong>Card Counting:</strong> Remember what colors have been played to predict opponents' hands.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Game Variants</h2>
        <p>PRISM offers different variants to adjust the level of information and strategic depth.</p>

        <h3>Standard Variant (Hidden Information)</h3>
        <p>This is the classic PRISM experience. All players start with 10 cards in hand, completely hidden from opponents. This creates maximum uncertainty and emphasizes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Memory and card counting</li>
            <li>Risk assessment</li>
            <li>Psychological reads</li>
            <li>Adapting to unexpected reveals</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Open Information Variant (Recommended for Strategic Players)</h3>
        <p>This variant reduces blind play and adds visible planning opportunities.</p>

        <div class="color-box">
            <h4>🎲 Setup Differences</h4>
            <p>Each player receives their 10 cards split into:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>5 cards in hand</strong> (hidden from opponents)</li>
                <li><strong>5 visible cards</strong> (face-up, visible to all players)</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="color-box">
            <h4>📋 Gameplay Rules</h4>
            <p><strong>Playing Cards:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>You can ONLY play cards from your hand (hidden cards)</li>
                <li>Visible cards cannot be played directly</li>
                <li>This maintains suspense while giving strategic information</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p><strong>Passing Cards:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Priority 1:</strong> Visible cards are passed FIRST (automatically, one per round)</li>
                <li>When you pass a visible card, it becomes HIDDEN for the player who receives it</li>
                <li><strong>Priority 2:</strong> Once all visible cards are exhausted, pass from your hand as in Standard variant</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="example">
            <strong>Example Round in Open Variant:</strong><br><br>
            <strong>Setup:</strong> You have Yellow 4, Blue 3, Red 2 visible. In hand: Purple 3, Green 4, Red 1, Blue 2, Yellow 1.<br><br>
            <strong>Round 1 - Play:</strong> You play Purple 3 from your hand. Your visible cards remain unchanged.<br><br>
            <strong>Round 1 - Pass:</strong> Your first visible card (Yellow 4) is automatically passed to the right. That player receives it in their hand (hidden). You now have 4 visible cards and 4 cards in hand.<br><br>
            <strong>Strategic Note:</strong> Everyone saw you pass Yellow 4! They know your opponent received it and can plan accordingly.
        </div>

        <h3>Why Play Open Information?</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Less "blind" gameplay:</strong> You know what cards are coming and where they'll go</li>
            <li><strong>Enhanced strategy:</strong> Plan several rounds ahead based on visible information</li>
            <li><strong>Social dynamics:</strong> "I'm passing you a Purple 4... you'd better play it!"</li>
            <li><strong>Reduced luck:</strong> Skilled players can better predict and control outcomes</li>
            <li><strong>Teaching tool:</strong> New players can observe what cards are in play</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="important">
            ⚠ï¸ <strong>Important:</strong> Once visible cards are depleted (after 5 rounds), both variants play identically. This creates an interesting transition from open information to hidden information mid-game!
