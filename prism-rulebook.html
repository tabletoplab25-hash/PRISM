        <h1>PRISM</h1>
        <p class="subtitle">A Strategic Color Card Game for 2-6 Players</p>

        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>PRISM is a tactical card game where each color has unique scoring abilities. Players must carefully choose which cards to play and which to pass to opponents, creating a dynamic game of strategy, prediction, and calculated risks.</p>

        <h2>Components</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Unique Deck:</strong> 5 colors (Red, Blue, Green, Yellow, Purple)</li>
            <li>Card distribution varies by player count (see table below)</li>
            <li>Each player receives exactly 10 cards</li>
        </ul>

        <table>
            <tr>
                <th>Players</th>
                <th>Numbers Range</th>
                <th>Total Cards</th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>2</td>
                <td>1-5</td>
                <td>25</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>3</td>
                <td>1-6</td>
                <td>30</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>4</td>
                <td>1-8</td>
                <td>40</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>5</td>
                <td>1-10</td>
                <td>50</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>6</td>
                <td>1-12</td>
                <td>60</td>
            </tr>
        </table>

        <h2>Card Values</h2>
        <p>Cards are divided into 4 point tiers based on their number. Higher numbers are worth more points.</p>
        
        <div class="example">
            <strong>Example (4 players, range 1-8):</strong><br>
            • Numbers 1-2 = 1 point<br>
            • Numbers 3-4 = 2 points<br>
            • Numbers 5-6 = 3 points<br>
            • Numbers 7-8 = 4 points
        </div>

        <h2>Setup</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Shuffle all cards together</li>
            <li>Deal 10 cards to each player</li>
            <li>All players start with 0 points</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Game Flow</h2>
        <p>The game consists of 10 rounds. Each round follows these phases:</p>

        <h3>1. Selection Phase</h3>
        <p>All players simultaneously choose one card from their hand to play face-down.</p>

        <h3>2. Reveal Phase</h3>
        <p>All cards are revealed simultaneously. Points are calculated based on each color's special ability (see Color Abilities section).</p>

        <h3>3. Passing Phase</h3>
        <p>Each player chooses one card from their remaining hand to pass to the player on their right. This is a strategic decision that affects future rounds.</p>

        <div class="important">
            ⚠️ IMPORTANT: The passing phase does NOT occur in round 10 (the final round).
        </div>

        <h2>Color Abilities</h2>
        <p>The core of PRISM's strategy lies in understanding how each color scores:</p>

        <div class="color-box">
            <h4>🔴 RED - Double or Nothing</h4>
            <p>The LOWEST red card scores double points. All other red cards score negative points.</p>
            <div class="example">
                <strong>Example:</strong> Red 2 (1pt), Red 5 (3pt), Red 7 (4pt) are played.<br>
                • Red 2 (1pt base) = +2 points (doubled!)<br>
                • Red 5 (3pt base) = -3 points<br>
                • Red 7 (4pt base) = -4 points
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="color-box">
            <h4>🔵 BLUE - Shared Pool</h4>
            <p>All blue card points are added together and divided equally among players who played blue (round down).</p>
            <div class="example">
                <strong>Example:</strong> Three players play Blue 2 (1pt), Blue 4 (2pt), and Blue 6 (3pt).<br>
                • Total pool: 1 + 2 + 3 = 6 points<br>
                • Each player gets: 6 ÷ 3 = 2 points
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="color-box">
            <h4>🟢 GREEN - Anti-Majority</h4>
            <p>Each green card loses 1 point for every LOWER green card played (minimum 0).</p>
            <div class="example">
                <strong>Example:</strong> Green 2, Green 5, Green 8 are played.<br>
                • Green 2 (1pt) - 0 lower greens = 1 point<br>
                • Green 5 (3pt) - 1 lower green = 2 points<br>
                • Green 8 (4pt) - 2 lower greens = 2 points
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="color-box">
            <h4>🟡 YELLOW - Relative Scoring</h4>
            <p><strong>+1 point</strong> for each OTHER yellow card played.<br>
            <strong>-1 point</strong> for each LOWER card of OTHER colors played.</p>
            <div class="example">
                <strong>Example:</strong> You play Yellow 8 (4pt base). Others play: Yellow 5, Yellow 10, Red 3, Green 6, Blue 7.<br>
                • Base: 4 points<br>
                • +2 points (two other yellows: 5 and 10)<br>
                • -3 points (three lower other colors: Red 3, Green 6, Blue 7)<br>
                • <strong>Total: 4 + 2 - 3 = 3 points</strong><br>
                <br>
                <strong>Note:</strong> Yellow 1 is always safe (no lower cards possible) but scores fewer points. High yellows score more base points but risk many lower cards!
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="color-box">
            <h4>🟣 PURPLE - Cooperation (Player Count Dependent)</h4>
            <p><strong>2-3 Players:</strong> Purple scores positive ONLY if you're the ONLY purple played. If others also play purple, you score negative.</p>
            <p><strong>4-6 Players:</strong> Purple scores positive if at least 1 OTHER purple is played. If you're the only purple, you score negative.</p>
            <div class="example">
                <strong>Example (2 players):</strong><br>
                • If only you play purple → Positive!<br>
                • If both play purple → Both negative!<br>
                <br>
                <strong>Example (5 players):</strong><br>
                • If 2+ purples played → All purples positive! (cooperation)<br>
                • If only 1 purple played → That player negative (no cooperation)
            </div>
        </div>

        <h2>End of Game</h2>
        <p>After 10 rounds, the game ends. The player with the highest total score wins!</p>

        <h2>Strategy Tips</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Red:</strong> Play low to win big, but watch out for even lower reds!</li>
            <li><strong>Blue:</strong> Safe and consistent. Good for medium-value cards.</li>
            <li><strong>Green:</strong> Play high to avoid penalties from lower greens.</li>
            <li><strong>Yellow:</strong> Complex but powerful. Predict what others will play.</li>
            <li><strong>Purple:</strong> Risk everything for cooperation (or uniqueness in 2-3p).</li>
            <li><strong>Passing:</strong> Give away dangerous cards or set up future combinations.</li>
            <li><strong>Card Counting:</strong> Remember what colors have been played to predict opponents' hands.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Game Variants</h2>
        <p>PRISM offers different variants to adjust the level of information and strategic depth.</p>

        <h3>Standard Variant (Hidden Information)</h3>
        <p>This is the classic PRISM experience. All players start with 10 cards in hand, completely hidden from opponents. This creates maximum uncertainty and emphasizes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Memory and card counting</li>
            <li>Risk assessment</li>
            <li>Psychological reads</li>
            <li>Adapting to unexpected reveals</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Open Information Variant (Recommended for Strategic Players)</h3>
        <p>This variant reduces blind play and adds visible planning opportunities.</p>

        <div class="color-box">
            <h4>🎲 Setup Differences</h4>
            <p>Each player receives their 10 cards split into:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>5 cards in hand</strong> (hidden from opponents)</li>
                <li><strong>5 visible cards</strong> (face-up, visible to all players)</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="color-box">
            <h4>📋 Gameplay Rules</h4>
            <p><strong>Playing Cards:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>You can ONLY play cards from your hand (hidden cards)</li>
                <li>Visible cards cannot be played directly</li>
                <li>This maintains suspense while giving strategic information</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p><strong>Passing Cards:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Priority 1:</strong> Visible cards are passed FIRST (automatically, one per round)</li>
                <li>When you pass a visible card, it becomes HIDDEN for the player who receives it</li>
                <li><strong>Priority 2:</strong> Once all visible cards are exhausted, pass from your hand as in Standard variant</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="example">
            <strong>Example Round in Open Variant:</strong><br><br>
            <strong>Setup:</strong> You have Yellow 8, Blue 3, Red 2 visible. In hand: Purple 5, Green 9, Red 10, Blue 7, Yellow 4.<br><br>
            <strong>Round 1 - Play:</strong> You play Purple 5 from your hand. Your visible cards remain unchanged.<br><br>
            <strong>Round 1 - Pass:</strong> Your first visible card (Yellow 8) is automatically passed to the right. That player receives it in their hand (hidden). You now have 4 visible cards and 4 cards in hand.<br><br>
            <strong>Strategic Note:</strong> Everyone saw you pass Yellow 8! They know your opponent received it and can plan accordingly.
        </div>

        <h3>Why Play Open Information?</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Less "blind" gameplay:</strong> You know what cards are coming and where they'll go</li>
            <li><strong>Enhanced strategy:</strong> Plan several rounds ahead based on visible information</li>
            <li><strong>Social dynamics:</strong> "I'm passing you a Purple 10... you'd better play it!"</li>
            <li><strong>Reduced luck:</strong> Skilled players can better predict and control outcomes</li>
            <li><strong>Teaching tool:</strong> New players can observe what cards are in play</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="important">
            ⚠️ <strong>Important:</strong> Once visible cards are depleted (after 5 rounds), both variants play identically. This creates an interesting transition from open information to hidden information mid-game!
